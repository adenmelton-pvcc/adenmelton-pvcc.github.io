            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><i>Engel v. Vitale</i> was not a simple case, based solely on separation of church and state. Through the power of judicial review, the Supreme Court had to distinguish how far the government was allowed to interfere with the beliefs and opinions of others. The Constitution, as president Woodrow Wilson once quoted, "was not made to fit us like a strait jacket. In its elasticity lies its chief greatness." That same elasticity is what the Supreme Court analyzes while deciding the verdict for <i>Engel v. Vitale</i></p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The case started with the New York School Board of Regents passing a piece of legislation that "authorized a short, voluntary prayer for recitation at the start of each school day" ("Engel v. Vitale" [<i>Oyez</i>]). The prayer was conducted immediately after the Pledge of Allegiance and, because it was voluntary, "the law allowed students to absent themselves from this activity if they found it objectionable" ("Facts and Case Summary").</p>
            <table><tr style="background-color:#EDAE49"><td><p>The prayer read:<br><p style="margin-left: 15px;">"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence on Thee, and beg Thy blessings upon us, our teachers, and our country" ("Engel v. Vitale" [<i>Khan Academy</i>])</p></td></tr></table>

            <p>Some parents did not approve of this legislation. Stephen Engel, the father of Michael Engel (a student at one of the schools that enacted the prayer), visited his son's school in Hyde Park, New York and saw his sone participating in the prayer. Being a Jew, Engel was upset to see this being enacted in public schools, kids clasping their hands and bowing their heads in prayer. After explaining to his son that that was not the way they say prayers ("Religion in Public Schools") and several other parents grouped together to protest the new voluntary morning prayer in the public schools. Once they saw protest was not the answer, Stephen Engel led the group of parents to sue school board president William Vitale.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><i>Engel v. Vitale</i> has been deemed as one of the most unpopular court cases in United States history because it was viewed as an attack on religion (especially Christianity)</li>

            </div>
            <p><i>Engel v. Vitale</i> further defined and outlined the continous struggle between church and state. On one hand, religion itself is one of the main principles that define America. The United States is well known for its religious freedom, and therefore many believe the government should have no interference with it. As this court case also highlights though, in order to protect the religious rights of others, the government must be somewhat involved to protect everyone's right toa free practice of religion.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:20px">Through <i>Engel v. Vitale</i>, since America holds a wide variety of religions and beliefs amongst the people, the government has no right to endorse, interfere, or prohibit any religion.</p>
            <table style="align-content: center;"><tr style="background-color:#EDAE49"><td><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><p style="margin-left:15px;">A common argument against the ruling in Engel v. Vitale is that “America's Framers did not intend for a complete and total separation of church and state, as seems to be the prevailing norm in today's society” (Lewis).</p></td></tr></table>
            <p>This case solidifies that the government, no matter the level of government, has to preserve total seperation of church and state and therefore must not allow for any one religion to be quintessential part of a public institution. This allows the government to therefore not violate the Establishment Clause in the First Amendment, as the government is not endorsing any particular religion.</p>
